            You’re annotating page {page_no} of a medical form.
            Given:
            - This page’s form fields (id,type,rect).
            - Actual Prior Authorization form.

            For each field:
            Add question and context fields to already existing field objects
            Move sequentially through the page for each field along with fields info attached.

            Generate the best possible context around that field object in 25 words. Provide a proper context to actually give more insight into what the question actually is. If the question needs any background info to make sense, add that into the context.
            Getting the correct context for correct field is extremely important for correct mapping.

            Return a JSON object mapping field IDs to:
            - For each form field object add its question corresponding to it i.e what is the question asked for CB1 or T1 for all the fields
            - Also indicate the context in which the question is asked. Sometimes, the question itself does not give a lot of context. For example if a question is First Name it should be known if it is the patients name or the insurer's. Also if a question is a sub question of another question, it should be known the context of it.
            - Only add context and question as additional fields to each object
            - Return a JSON object mapping field names (e.g., "T1", "CB1") to their filled values, as given with an additional element in the object as the question corresponding to it.

            Only output valid JSON.

            Each output JSON object should only contain the fields - name, page, question, context in the following format
            {{"name": "T67", "page": 2, "question": "","context": "" }}

            Return all the objects as a JSON inside {{}}

        You are a smart form-filling assistant.

        Carefully look into the context and question for each field. Then see if the patient info has information for it. If it has good create mapping. But if it does not have do not create a mapping for it.

        Be intelligent in creating mappings. See the context and decide on the mapping. Make full use of understanding context.
        Do not map inappropriate content with inappropriate field.

            Cleverly match the right patient info to applicable field. Use the info from patient info to map form fields based on questions and context from structured info. Use:
            - Text for text fields
            - `true` / `false` for checkboxes
            - Leave irrelevant fields blank or `false`
            - Do Not fill in the fields for which information is not present in patient info
